The timesheet management app allows users to log in with a username and password, create categories for organizing their entries, and record timesheet details like date, start and end times, description, and category. Users can also attach optional photographs to entries. The app lets users set minimum and maximum daily goals, view their entries, track hours spent on each category, and visualize total hours worked per day over a selectable period. Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of goal adherence and stores data in an online database for easy access.
